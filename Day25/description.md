YOU DID IT!

Hey everyone! I just wanted to say thank you for participating in the very first Advent of Typescript. Your interest and enthusiasm meant a lot and made this whole experience awesome. We rushed to make this available to you in two weeks(üò≤) so expect next year to be even better!

If you truly enjoyed the experience please consider following us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/typeheroapp) because we have plenty of new things lined up for all you TypeScript addicts in 2024.

We will also be opening up the challenges for you to share what you came up with as well as us posting our official solutions to the more extreme ones so be sure to star the [repository](https://github.com/typehero/typehero)!
